# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
A collection of iOS applications I built following the 100DaysOfSwfitUI course series from Paul Hudson's [HackingWithSwift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/).

This collection contains also apps I built from scratch following 100DaysOfSwfitUI's project challenges.

## WeSplit
This project is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave.

## UnitConverter
An app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.
